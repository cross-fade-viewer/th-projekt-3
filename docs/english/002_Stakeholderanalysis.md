# Stakeholder analysis

A stakeholder mapping and the actual stakeholder analysis were created for the stakeholder analysis.

**Developer:** Anyone who is developing the project further.

**Art historians:** The people who will primarily use the project.

**People interested in art:** People who are interested in art and want to use the project in their free time, for example.
