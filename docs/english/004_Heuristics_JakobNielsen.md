# Heuristics by Jakob Nielsen

When creating our application, we followed Jakob Nielsen's 10 heuristics to design the user interface and thus create a user-friendly design.

These 10 heuristics would be:

1. System status visibility
2. Consistency of system and reality
3. User Control and Freedom
4. Consistency and Standards
5. Error prevention
6. Recognition instead of memory
7. Flexibility and efficiency
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
9. Assistance in detecting, evaluating and correcting errors
10. Help and Documentation
