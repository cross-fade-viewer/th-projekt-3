# Release of the NPM package
Our npm package is published on npmjs.com.

## Steps:
1. Create a new account on npmjs.com.
2. In Visual Studio Code, type the command npm adduser. Then enter the username, password, and email address associated with your account.
3. Confirm the login when specifying the npm whoami command which should return the logged in username to confirm that YOU are logged in to npm using CLI.
4. To check what files are packed into your npm package, we can use the npm publish --dry-run command.
5. The npm publish command WILL publish your npm package.
6. Once published, YOU should be able to view your npm package page on npmjs.com.
