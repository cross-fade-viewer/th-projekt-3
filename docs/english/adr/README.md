# ADR-Readme

Architecture Decision Record (ADR) are documents that record important explanations of architectural decisions.

In our ADRs, we discuss which architectural choices were available and describe why we made each choice. Afterwards we also describe the consequences of our choice.

We used the [Alexandria pattern](alexandrian-pattern.md) as a template for our architecture decisions.
